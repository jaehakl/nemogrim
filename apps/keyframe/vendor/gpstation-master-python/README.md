# GP Station v1 Master Python SDK

Async Python SDK for the master side of the GP Station v1 job runtime.

## Install

```powershell
cd app_v1/sdk/master/python
poetry install
```

The SDK requires Python 3.11 through 3.14. Client-scoped access tokens should be supplied at runtime, for example through an environment variable.

## Run one job

```python
import asyncio
import os

from gpstation_master import GpStationClient


async def main() -> None:
    async with GpStationClient(
        api_base_url="https://gps.qutat.com",
        token=os.environ["GPSTATION_CLIENT_TOKEN"],
    ) as client:
        launchers = await client.list_launchers()
        print(launchers)

        result = await client.run_job(
            "ai.llm",
            {"prompt": "hello", "max_tokens": 128},
            slave_app_id="ai",
        )
        print(result.payload)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Keep a job session open

Set `auto_finish=False` to make more than one ordered call over the same WebRTC DataChannel. Finish the session explicitly before leaving the client context.

```python
first = await client.run_job(
    "ai.chat",
    {"prompt": "hello"},
    auto_finish=False,
)

followup = await first.session.call(
    "ai.chat",
    {"prompt": "Summarize the previous answer."},
)

await first.session.finish()
print(first.payload, followup.payload)
```

## Events and attachments

Callbacks are synchronous and run in DataChannel arrival order. Delegate slow work with `asyncio.create_task` so it does not delay result handling.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from gpstation_master import JobEvent, RequestAttachment


def on_event(event: JobEvent) -> None:
    if event.type == "ai.chat.delta":
        print(event.payload)


result = await client.run_job(
    "ai.sdxl.inpaint",
    {
        "prompts": ["a renovated room with warm lighting"],
        "strength": 0.8,
        "width": 1024,
        "height": 1024,
    },
    on_event=on_event,
    attachments=[
        RequestAttachment(
            id="image",
            name="input.png",
            mime_type="image/png",
            data=Path("input.png").read_bytes(),
        ),
        RequestAttachment(
            id="mask",
            name="mask.png",
            mime_type="image/png",
            data=Path("mask.png").read_bytes(),
        ),
    ],
)

for received_file in result.files:
    Path(received_file.name or received_file.id).write_bytes(received_file.data)
```

Each request attachment is limited to 20 MiB. Files are transferred directly over the job DataChannel and are not uploaded through the REST API.

## Prewarm and cookie authentication

`await client.prewarm_job_connection()` gathers an offer and ICE candidates ahead of the next matching job. Successful auto-finished jobs refill the cache in the background.

Cookie authentication is intended for an existing website session. Supply its cookies and use the web job prefix; unsafe `/web/` requests automatically fetch and refresh a CSRF token.

```python
async with GpStationClient(
    api_base_url="https://gps.qutat.com",
    auth_mode="cookie",
    job_api_prefix="/web/jobs",
    cookies={"<session-cookie-name>": "..."},
) as client:
    result = await client.run_job("ai.llm", {"prompt": "hello"})
```

## Verify

```powershell
poetry run pytest
poetry build
```
